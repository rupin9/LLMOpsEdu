The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Sometimes a lymph node might suggest cancer in the larynx/throat...     3.     The last possibility is of sebaceous cyst or some other cysts like infected branchial cyst or lymphatic cysts!
